# Q-Learning TurtleBot Navigation System

A comprehensive Q-learning implementation for autonomous robot navigation with real-time visualization, advanced reward shaping, and detailed performance analytics.

## ü§ñ Project Overview

This project implements an enhanced Q-learning algorithm that successfully trains a TurtleBot to navigate through a complex maze environment. The system addresses common Q-learning challenges including sparse rewards, exploration-exploitation balance, and convergence issues.

**Key Achievement**: 100% success rate with the robot reaching its goal in an average of 18.8 steps after training.

## üß† How We Solved Q-Learning Challenges

### Problem: Sparse Reward Learning
**Challenge**: Traditional Q-learning with only goal rewards (+1) and step penalties (-1) provides no learning signal over long distances.

**Solution**: Distance-based reward shaping
```python
# Reward system that guides learning
if new_distance < old_distance:
    reward = 0.1   # Moving closer to goal
elif new_distance > old_distance:
    reward = -0.05  # Moving away from goal
else:
    reward = -0.02  # Neutral move
if goal_reached:
    reward = 10.0   # Large goal reward
```

### Problem: Exploration vs Exploitation
**Challenge**: Too much exploration wastes time, too little gets stuck in local minima.

**Solution**: Adaptive epsilon decay
```python
# Slower decay maintains exploration longer
epsilon = max(0.05, 0.9 * (0.999 ** episode))
```

### Problem: Poor Initialization
**Challenge**: Random Q-values provide no initial guidance toward the goal.

**Solution**: Goal-biased initialization
```python
# Initialize Q-table with goal attraction
Q = np.random.rand(rows, cols, actions) * 0.01  # Small random values
Q[goal[0], goal[1], :] = 10.0  # High values at goal
```
